# Hackathon-February-2020
 Our Code is mainly written in HTML, CSS and Python.

1.  To run our webapp, we will first have to install news api by going into windows Powershel.
  Type - pip install newsapi-python - into it. Let it install. 
2. We will also have to install Flask for python. For that, type 
  - pip install flask - into windows powershell. 

We have completed our installations. For our purpose, we used Visual Studio Code. We are not familiar with other IDE or Code Editors.

3. Now, make a folder somewhere on your computer. This folder can be named anything, let us call it "Project Folder".

4. Add app.py in this folder. And make a new folder named "templates" inside the folder "Project folder".

5. Now add all the .html files into the "templates" folder.
6. open folder "Project folder" in VS Code. Run app.py and get the server link. 
It usually comes out to be "http://127.0.0.1:5000/". Open this on Chrome or other Browser.

Our Website is a Personalised News based app. We can hover on the Navigation Bar given on the top and go to any of the given Sections.
We are able to access news Columns like -
1. General Headlines
2. Sports
3. Business
4. Health
5. Technology
6. Science
7. Corona Stats !! 

Yes our website also gives you feed of Corona updates as provided by the API .
We recommend you to get your API code from the website "https://newsapi.org/" 

We would also like to mention that there is a small bug that is to be fixed. The bug is that when we go on Corona Stats tab, the other navigation bar links becomes non clickable, and hence we have to go back after going on Corona Tab. This bug is not present with any other navigation tab.
