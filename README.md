# Hackathon-February-2020

# Our Code is written in HTML, CSS and Python.

1.  To run our webapp, we will first have to install news api by going into windows Powershel.
  Type - pip install newsapi-python - into it. Let it install. 
2. We will also have to install Flask for python. For that, type 
  - pipenv install flask flask-sqlalchemy - into windows powershell. 

We have completed our installations. For our purpose, we used Visual Studio Code. We are not familiar with other IDE or Code Editors.

3. Now, make a folder somewhere on your computer. This folder can be named anything, let us call it "Project Folder".

4. Add app.py in this folder. And make a new folder named "templates" inside the folder "Project folder".

5. Now add all the .html files into the "templates" folder.
6. open folder "Project folder" in VS Code. Run app.py and get the server link. 
It usually comes out to be "http://127.0.0.1:5000/". Open this on Chrome or other Browser.
